Hands-On: OpenAppsRecon Demo
Follow these steps to work with the OpenAppsRecon demo:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have a Python development environment set up. If not, refer to the instructions here for guidance on setting up the Python development environment.
Getting Started
Download the Siemens raw data converted to Python NumPy format from this link. Save the downloaded file to your Python installation folder.

Download the sample Python file for performing a reconstruction from this link. Save the downloaded file to your Python installation folder.

Execute the sample program recon_nparray.py and observe the results in your setup. The expected output should appear.

Modifying the Sample Program
Modify the recon_nparray.py sample program according to your needs. For example, you can try inverting the data or implementing other changes.

Download the additional Python script nparray-call.py from this link and save it to your Python installation folder.

Open the nparray-call.py file in your preferred Python IDE and execute it. For instructions on how to execute, refer to the instructions provided here.

Integration
Once you have a working Python code (modified recon_nparray.py), you can hand it over for integration.
Feel free to explore and experiment with the provided code and resources. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the OpenAppsRecon documentation and resources available on their GitHub repository.
