# Hands-On: OpenAppsRecon
## Follow these steps to work with the OpenAppsRecon demo:

1. Make sure you have a Python development environment set up. If not, refer to the instructions https://github.com/OpenAppsRecon/demo for guidance on setting up the Python development environment.

2. Download the Siemens raw data converted to Python NumPy format from https://github.com/OpenAppsRecon/demo/tree/main/OpenRecon/raw.npy. Save the downloaded file to your Python installation folder.

3. Download the sample Python file for performing a reconstruction from https://github.com/OpenAppsRecon/demo/tree/main/OpenRecon/recon_nparray.py. Save the downloaded file to your Python installation folder.

4. Execute the sample program recon_nparray.py and observe the results in your setup. The expected output should appear as below:

5. Modify the recon_nparray.py sample program according to your needs. For example, you can try inverting the data or implementing other changes.

6. Download the additional Python script nparray-call.py from https://github.com/OpenAppsRecon/demo/tree/main/OpenRecon/nparray-call.py and save it to your Python installation folder.

7. Open the nparray-call.py file in your preferred Python IDE and execute it. For instructions on how to execute, refer to the instructions provided at https://github.com/OpenAppsRecon/demo.

8. Once you have a working Python code (modified recon_nparray.py), you can hand it over for integration.
